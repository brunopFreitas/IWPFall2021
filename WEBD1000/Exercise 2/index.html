            Five little ducks went out one day,<br />
            <b>Over the hills and far away.</b><br />
            <b>Mother duck said, "quack quack quack quack,"</b><br />
            But only four little ducks came back.<br />

        <p>
            Four little ducks went out one day,<br />
            <b>Over the hills and far away.</b><br />
            <b>Mother duck said, "quack quack quack quack,"</b><br />
            But only three little ducks came back.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Three little ducks went out one day,<br />
            <b>Over the hills and far away.</b><br />
            <b>Mother duck said, "quack quack quack quack,"</b><br />
            But only two little ducks came back.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Two little ducks went out one day,<br />
            <b>Over the hills and far away.</b><br />
            <b>Mother duck said, "quack quack quack quack,"</b><br />
            But only one little duck came back.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
            One little duck went out one day,<br />
            <b>Over the hills and far away.</b><br />
            <b>Mother duck said, "quack quack quack quack,"</b><br />
            But none of the five little ducks came back.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
            So sad Mother duck went out one day,<br />
            <b>Over the hills and far away.</b><br />
            <b>Mother duck said, "quack quack quack quack,"</b><br />
            And all of the five little ducks came back.<br />
